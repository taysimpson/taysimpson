- 👋 Hi, I’m @taysimpson
- 👀 I’m interested in purchasing a code that deals with arbitrage trades via crypto exchanges. Specifically a 'plug and play' code. I need to be able to insert any exchange by way of API. Plus it needs to be coded so I can input one exchange where an asset is purchased and another place to input an exchange where that same asset can be sold. The code also needs to have a place to enter a wallet address of said asset being traded.
